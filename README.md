# QSExtensions_altStateActions

This extension gets you two buttons that you will need if you want a user to 
work with Alternate States in Qlik Sense: A "Copy From Main State" button and 
a "Clear Alternate State" button. Labels and styles can be changed. 
You need other extensions found here on Branch to introduce the Alternate States 
and to assign objects to a certain State (setObjectState).
