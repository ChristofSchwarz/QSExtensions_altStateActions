# Alternate State Actions

(reworked for Qlik Sense September 2020)

This extension gets the user up to 4 buttons which he/she will need to work with Alternate States in Qlik Sense

 * A "Copy Main State > Alternate State" button
 * A "Copy Alternate State > Main State" button
 * A "Clear Main State" button
 * A "Clear Alternate State" button
 
Labels and styles can be changed. 

*Note*: the target state first gets cleared from all existing selections before syncing them from the source state

I can think of a future version, that would copy selections only of specific fields between states, not always of all fields ...
