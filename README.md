# QSExtensions_altStateActions

This extension gets you two buttons that you will need if you want a user to 
work with Alternate States in Qlik Sense: A "Copy From Main State" button and 
a "Clear Alternate State" button. Labels and styles can be changed. 

The developer needs my other extension to introduce the Alternate States first
and to assign objects to such a State (http://branch.qlik.com/#project/569368a0fe261eb8649bf582).
